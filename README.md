> Warning
> This is Sean Strantalis's scoped fork of `ghostty-web`, intended for Workset integration and local alpha publishing. Upstream docs and issues still live with the original project lineage.

[Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) for the web with [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser.

- Migrate from xterm by changing your import: `@xterm/xterm` → `@strantalis/workset-ghostty-web`
- WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app
- Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle

Originally created for [Mux](https://github.com/coder/mux) (a desktop app for isolated, parallel agentic development), but designed to be used anywhere.

## Try It

- [Live Demo](https://ghostty.ondis.co) on an ephemeral VM (thank you to Greg from [disco.cloud](https://disco.cloud) for hosting).

- On your computer:

  ```bash
  bun run demo
  ```

  This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on `http://localhost:8080`. Works best on Linux and macOS.

## Comparison with xterm.js

xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:

| Issue                                    | xterm.js                                                         | workset-ghostty-web        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Complex scripts** (Devanagari, Arabic) | Rendering issues                                                 | ✓ Proper grapheme handling |
| **XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR**                   | [Not supported](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/2570) | ✓ Full support             |

xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @strantalis/workset-ghostty-web
```

## Usage

`@strantalis/workset-ghostty-web` aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.

```javascript
import { init, Terminal } from '@strantalis/workset-ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) => websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) => term.write(e.data);
```

For a comprehensive client <-> server example, refer to the [demo](./demo/index.html#L141).

If you use overlay scrollbars or reserve scrollback space elsewhere, configure the fit addon
explicitly instead of patching terminal internals:

```typescript
import { FitAddon } from '@strantalis/workset-ghostty-web';

const fitAddon = new FitAddon({ scrollbarWidth: 0 });
term.loadAddon(fitAddon);
```

## Development

ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a [patch](./patches/ghostty-wasm-api.patch) to expose additional
functionality.

> Requires Zig and Bun.

```bash
bun run build
```

## Local Publishing

For local Workset prerelease flows, use the root `Makefile`:

```bash
make publish-workset
```

That bumps the package to the next `workset` prerelease, builds it, and publishes with the `workset` dist-tag. If you still think of these as "alphas," `make publish-alpha` is kept as an alias.
For a stable local publish, set an explicit version:

```bash
make publish-release VERSION=0.3.1
```

Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has [been working](https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming) on `libghostty` which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.

This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.

At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.
